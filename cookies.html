                <p>This Cookie Policy describes how Ozeety uses cookies and similar technologies on the website
                    <span class="accentText">https://Ozeety.com</span> and relevant mobile applications (the “Website”),

                    how
                    to control cookies, and other related terms. This Website is governed and operated by Sapian Group
                    registration number 196344, having its legal address at PO BOX 123004 Dubaï, UAE (“Ozeety”, “we” or
                    “us”).</p>

                <p>This Cookie Policy is the integral part of the Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”). All capitalized
                    terms
                    used in the Terms shall apply to this Cookie Policy with the same meanings as in the Terms.</p>

                <p>By browsing, accessing and using our Website and Services, you agree to proceed on the basis of this
                    Cookie Policy and you agree with the conditions of processing the User’s personal data contained in
                    this
                    document.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">1. About Cookies</h5>

                <p>Like many websites we use cookie and other similar technologies (“cookie”). A “cookie” is a piece of
                    information in the form of a small text file that is placed on a user’s hard drive. It is generated
                    by a
                    web page server, which is basically the computer that operates a web site. The information the
                    cookie
                    contains is set by the server and it can be used by that server whenever the user visits the
                    Website. A
                    cookie can be thought of as the user’s identification card, which tell the Website when the user has
                    returned.</p>

                <p>Cookies are not computer programs or codes, they are not used to transfer viruses. Modern versions of
                    browsers allow users to reject or opt out of receiving cookies as detailed below.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">2. The Cookies used on the website</h5>

                <p>The type of cookies used on the Website can be classified as follows:</p>

                <p class="accentText">Essential First Party Cookies</p>

                <p>Essential First Party Cookies are strictly necessary cookies that enable you to browse the Website
                    and
                    use its tools and features. These essential cookies allow us to provide you with the services you

                    secure areas of the Website. Without them you may not be able to use our Website partially or in

                    and related top domain names.
                </p>

                    cannot
                    refuse them.</p>

                <p class="accentText">Analytics Cookies</p>

                <p>Analytics cookies are not personally identifiable cookies. They allow users to navigate through the
                    pages and while navigating, these cookies collect information about which pages you visit and how
                    you
                    use online services. This allows us to improve our services and your user experience with us.</p>

                <p class="accentText">Security</p>

                <p>Security cookies are used in order to enable security features, and to detect any violations of our
                    Terms.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">3. What are the purposes we use Cookies for?</h5>

                <p>Based on the above, we use cookies to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>allow users navigate through pages and use our Services;</li>
                    <li>remember user’s preferences;</li>
                    <li>enable security features;</li>
                    <li>improve the Website and user experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">4. How can I control Cookies?</h5>

                <p>If you wish to delete any cookies that are placed on your computer, you may refer to the help and
                    support section in your internet browser. Modern browsers allow users to reject, delete or opt out
                    of
                    receiving cookies. However, it should be noted that if cookies are placed by third party websites,
                    you
                    must manage these cookies directly from the relevant third party.</p>

                <p>For more information about cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit: <span
                        class="accentText">www.AboutCookies.org</span></p>

                <p>By deleting, rejecting or opting out of receiving future cookies, you may not be able to enjoy all
                    features of the Website and to access certain areas of the Website.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">5. How long does a Cookie stay on your device?</h5>

                <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer depends on whether such cookie is a session or
                    permanent cookie.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">6. Session Cookie</h5>

                <p>Session cookie is usually stored as a session ID during the user’s browsing session and is not
                    personally identifiable. Session cookies are never written on the hard drive. When user completes
                    the
                    session and closes the browser, these cookies are automatically deleted from the user’s computer.
                    Session cookies expire at the end of the user's browser session and can also become no longer
                    accessible
                    after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 minutes.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">7. Permanent Cookie</h5>

                <p>Unlike session cookie, permanent cookie is stored on the user’s computer even after the user’s
                    browser
                    is closed. Permanent cookies allow to remember user’s preferences to be used in the future browsing
                    sessions.</p>

                <p>By its nature permanent cookie can be used to identify individual users and analyse user’s surfing
                    behavior on the Website. They are usually stored for a prolonged period of time, in some cases many
                    years into the future.</p>

                <h5 class="accentText mt-5">8. Third party Cookies</h5>

                <p>Please be aware that some cookies are placed on your computer by third parties, other than Ozeety. We
                    do
                    not control such cookies as well as how such third parties use cookies. These cookies are used by
                    third
                    parties to provide services to us. You may collect more information on how these third parties use
                    cookies and disable them by visiting their own third party’s cookie and privacy policies.</p>
